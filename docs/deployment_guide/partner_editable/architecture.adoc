.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/thousandeyes-architecture_diagram.png[Architecture, 85%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* https://aws.amazon.com/pm/connect/[Amazon Connect^], which communicates with the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/agent-user-guide.html[Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel (CCP)^] softphone client app using the https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-streams[Amazon Connect Streams API^]. 
** The Amazon Connect Health widget is integrated into the CCP. This widget displays end-user metrics from the ThousandEyes https://www.thousandeyes.com/resources/getting-started-endpoint-agent-tutorial[Endpoint Agent^] software. You can edit the client-side code to show additional metrics in the widget.
** The Endpoint Agent software comprises a browser plugin and a lightweight system service installed on end-user Windows or macOS laptops or desktops. 
* Amazon API Gateway, which sets up the ThousandEyes metrics service.
* AWS Lambda functions, which query the customer's deployed Endpoint Agent software. Among other things, these functions display the response time of the server (Amazon Connect instance), the strength of the Wi-Fi signal, and the network latency.
* An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for the Lambda functions.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) to store the metrics.
