== Postdeployment steps

=== Embed the ThousandEyes client widget

You can use the included example client code in the `softphone-client` folder to embed a ThousandEyes metrics widget on the same webpage that you embed the Amazon Connect CCP.  
Integrating ThousandEyes metrics allows you display the health of each of your end user's connection to Amazon Connect based on ThousandEyes monitoring.

. Clone the https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-thousandeyes-amazon-connect/[quickstart-thousandeyes-amazon-connect GitHub repository^].
. In the `softphone-client` folder, open the `index.html` file. This is an example file and javascript that shows how to embed the ThousandEyes widget alongside the Amazon Connect CCP.
. Fill in the required variables:
* `instanceURL` - URL of your Amazon Connect instance.
* `metricsURL` - URL of the ThousandEyes metrics API service you deployed.
* `defaultHostName` - Default hostname that identifies the end-user machine; this should be the same name as the computer name reported by the Endpoint Agent software.
* `defaultTestName` - Name of the endpoint scheduled test that monitors your Amazon Connect instance.
* `defaultAccountGroup` - ThousandEyes account group name that has the Amazon Connect test.
* `refreshS` - Frequency (in seconds) to update health metrics. Should not be less than 60.

Here is an example code snippet from `index.html`:

[source,html]
----
<div id="ccpContainer1">
   <script>
      var instanceURL = "https://acmebusiness.my.connect.aws/connect/ccp#/";
      var metricsURL = "https://jur5bq3i8a.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1";
      var defaultHostName = "hans-mac-us";
      var defaultAccountGroup = "Endpoint Agent";
      var defaultTestName = "Amazon Connect";
      var refreshS = 60;
      var container = document.getElementById("ccpContainer");
      var ccpURL = instanceURL;
      init();
   </script>
</div>
----

You can copy the contents of `index.html` as well as the `/js/common.js` file to your web server. You can also upload the contents of the `softphone-client` folder to an Amazon S3 bucket to run as an example static webpage to see the widget in action.

You should now see the ThousandEyes Amazon Connect Health widget on your Amazon Connect client webpage. <<healthwidget>> shows an example of what the widget looks like embedded at the bottom of the default Amazon Connect CCP widget.

As shown in <<settings>>, you can modify the ThousandEyes *Host Name* (Endpoint Agent), *Account Group*, or *Test Name* (endpoint schedule test). To do so, choose the settings icon (gear). The client-side code stores these names as cookies so that they do not change on browser refresh.
